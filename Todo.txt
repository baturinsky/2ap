Ideas

Moving target: bonus to def proportional to move if attacked while moving, or ended turn with movement or melee.
Shock: malus to def and acc proportional to HP loss, doubled for hp loss in previous turn. Some attacks give extra shock.
Prone: assumed willingly, or as a result of some atttacks. Disables step-out. -50% def against melee.
Observe action: -25% def, bonus to vision range and acc next turn.
Focus fire: up to 25% accuracy against same unmoving target, up to 10% accuracy against nearby targets.
Stress/Alert: units in combat (alerted) accumulated stress for each action depending on it's complexity. Stress gives penalty to acc and def.
Units not in combat slowly lose stress, but have reduced vision and can only make 1 move action per turn.
Smoke: reduces acc for all shots through, in, or from it. Reduces visibility (?). Destroying any obstacle creates a small smoke cloud.
Cover fire: each one making any action in target area has a chance to be shot at reduced acc. Reduces def.
